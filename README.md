# ComputerVision-Licence_Plate_Detection
This project has been done by using OpenCV package in Python. The objective is to train the computer to read the license plates whenever the computer camera encounters a vehicle and store the pictures of only the license plate to keep a track of all the vehicles.  It involves the concept of Image Recognition.
