# ComputerVision-Licence_Plate_Detection
This project has been done by using OpenCV package in Python. The objective is to train the computer to read the license plates whenever the computer camera encounters a vehicle and store the pictures of only the license plate to keep a track of all the vehicles.  It involves the concept of Image Recognition. 

Automatic Licence Plate Recognition(ALPR) is a very advanced and intelligent system that has various real-life use cases, without any human intervention such as - 

1. Traffic violation: The ALPR can be used by police or law enforcement to identify any traffic violation by a vehicle at a traffic light using only a single camera. It can also be used to identify any stolen or non-registered vehicles in real-time.

2. Parking management: Parking management at many places requires a lot of human interaction, But due to ALPR it can be reduced to zero. The camera installed in the parking lots can recognize the plates at the entrance and store them in a database or allow the vehicles only if they are in the database. At the time of exit, the plate can be recognized again and can be charged accordingly.

3. Tollbooth payments: At highways, manual toll booths get hectic and can lead to huge traffic. Using ANPR, toll booths can recognize the license plates and receive payments automatically.
